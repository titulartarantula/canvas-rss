# Classification overrides for feature option vs feature setting.
#
# By default, entries are classified based on the "Feature Option to Enable"
# table cell in release/deploy notes:
#   - Real value -> feature_option (canonical admin toggle)
#   - N/A, empty, or absent -> feature_setting (non-toggle change)
#
# Use these overrides to force specific entries into the correct category.

classification_overrides:
  # Force specific entries as feature_options even if table says N/A
  force_options: []
    # - "some_edge_case_option_id"

  # Force specific entries as feature_settings even if table has a canonical name
  force_settings: []
    # - "some_misleading_option_id"
